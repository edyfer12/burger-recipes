This is a website showing recipes for creating burgers. The real-world example helped me recap my practical knowledge on writing HTML tags and elements and adding CSS elements. Additionally, this has increased my understanding on the website's user interface if HTML is only applied and also when CSS is added to make the page
modern fashioned.
