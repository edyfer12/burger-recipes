    <!-- Include two paragraphs -->

    <p>If you have ever been to McDonalds anywhere around the world, you may have tried the authentic and tasty Big Mac and more likely
    seen it. The Big Mac recipe includes the two sesame seed buns (top and bottom), round slice bread for middle, cheese, shredded 
    lettuce, two beef patties, pickles, minced onions and secret-sauce named Thousand Island dressing.</p>

    <p>If you are unsure of the preservatives that McDonalds serves you or want to save money or time, why not
     create your own and eat Big Mac at home instead?</p>
