    <h2>Description</h2>

    <!-- Include two paragraphs -->

    <p>The buttermilk chicken is very crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Buttermilk is a popular ingredient
    for making southern-style fried chicken or tenders. This ingredient is beneficial that the coating becomes very
    sticky all the flour never falls off when chicken is dipped.</p>

    <p>What makes fried-chicken burger very tasty? When you bite into the chicken, not only the breading is tasty, but the
    garlic powder, paprika and cayenne pepper make it so wonderful. Inside the burger, what makes it bolder in taste
    is the lettuce, milk buns and mayonaise</p>
